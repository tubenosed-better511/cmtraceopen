# CMTrace Open

A free, open-source log viewer and Windows troubleshooting tool. Drop in a log file and start reading — no install wizards, no prerequisites, no license keys.

Built as a modern replacement for Microsoft's CMTrace.exe with added Intune diagnostics, DSRegCmd analysis, and real-time log tailing.

## Quick Start

2. **Run** the executable — no install required (or use the MSI on Windows)
3. **Open a log** — drag and drop a file, use File > Open, or use a source preset
4. **Explore** — use Find (Ctrl+F), Filter, or switch to the Intune/DSRegCmd workspace

## Supported Log Formats

| Format | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| CCM | `<![LOG[...]LOG]!>` — ConfigMgr client logs |
| CBS / DISM / Panther | `CBS.log`, `dism.log`, `setupact.log`, `setuperr.log` |
| Simple | `$$<` delimited — older SCCM-style logs |
| Plain text | Any `.log` or `.txt` file with or without timestamps |

Format detection is automatic. Open any log file and CMTrace Open will pick the right parser.
