# CMTrace Open — Feature Improvements Roadmap

Internal planning document focused on unfinished work. Active priorities stay
near the top; shipped work is summarized at the bottom for reference.

**Status key**: Active Focus = current priority, Next Slice = recommended
near-term implementation, In Progress = partially shipped with clear follow-on
work, Completed = shipped unless a regression is found  
**Priority key**: P0 = critical path, P1 = high value, P2 = useful follow-on, P3
= future consideration  
**Effort key**: S = small (< 4 hours), M = medium (4–16 hours), L = large (16–40
hours), XL = 40+ hours

Feature requests 
- DHCP Log prasing, client and server
- MSI log prasing
- PSADT logging
- Add dir for %windir% logs software
- Software Install Failure workspace

- update documentation to show off how to use each workspace.
- make the sidebar in the logviewer optional.

## Active Focus

The evidence-bundle intake baseline is now in place. The current focus is
finishing Push 3 parser hardening beyond the first CBS/DISM/Panther salvage
pass, then moving into the first correlated investigation views and the
remaining workflow backlog without re-opening already-shipped intake work.

## Recommended Next Implementation Slice

1. Continue Push 3 with another sample-driven hardening slice, prioritizing
   remaining noisy parser families and IME rule gaps rather than adding
   speculative formats.
2. Start Push 4 by turning the existing evidence inventory, registry snapshot
   preview, and curated event export preview into correlated investigation
   views.
3. Pull in isolated Push 5 workflow wins only where they do not interrupt the
   evidence-first path.
4. Leave broad parser expansion, scale work, and advanced integrations behind
   validated evidence gaps.

---

## Push Backlog Status

This is the current state of the evidence-first push backlog that replaced the
older phase ordering.

### Push 1 — Evidence Intake Foundation — Completed

- Canonical evidence-bundle intake now follows the tracked bundle shape and
  script-produced `manifest.json` + `notes.md` + `evidence/` layout.
- Bundle inspection classifies artifacts into logs, registry snapshots,
  event-log exports, command output, screenshots, exports, and unknown
  artifacts.
- Intake now exposes recognized source families, parser selection, parse
  diagnostics, and obvious missing-evidence gaps through the bundle summary
  flow.
- The first evidence inventory UI is shipped via the bundle summary dialog, with
  artifact inventory, expected evidence, notes, and manifest preview.

### Push 2 — Adjacent Evidence Foundation — Mostly Completed

- Registry snapshot inspection is shipped for exported `.reg` snapshots and is
  surfaced as structured adjacent evidence in the bundle flow.
- Curated event-log export intake is shipped as adjacent evidence preview for
  offline/exported artifacts under the same bundle shape.
- Provenance is retained across log, Intune, and dsregcmd bundle-backed views.
- Remaining work is to turn these previews into richer correlated investigation
  surfaces instead of stopping at intake and preview.

### Push 3 — Parser Hardening and Evidence Quality — In Progress

- Artifact-level parser quality diagnostics are shipped in the intake summary.
- CBS, DISM, and Panther now salvage structurally valid timestamped records with
  unexpected level tokens instead of dropping them to raw fallback.
- Remaining work is to keep hardening the next highest-value parser and IME rule
  gaps from real samples, using the same regression-driven approach.

### Push 4 — Correlated Investigation Views — Not Started

- The prerequisites now exist: bundle inventory, registry snapshot preview,
  curated event export preview, provenance, and parser quality diagnostics.
- The next slice should correlate logs, registry state, and adjacent event
  evidence into source-aware investigation views.

### Push 5 — Workflow and CMTrace Parity — Not Started

- Time delta, Save As/export, regex find/filter, quick severity filters, richer
  status-bar counts, and stronger embedded error lookup remain open.

### Push 6 — Parser and Diagnostics Expansion — Not Started

- Additional parser families such as WindowsUpdate, SetupAPI, MSI,
  ReportingEvents expansion, and follow-on Intune maintenance remain open behind
  sample demand.

### Push 7 — Performance and Scale — Not Started

- Incremental parsing, multi-file preparation, and large-investigation scaling
  remain open.

### Push 8 — Advanced Integration and Polish — Not Started

- Remote collection convergence, MDM report viewing, print/history/bookmarks,
  CLI shaping, and optional Graph enrichment remain open.

---

## Prioritized Backlog: Next Implementation Slices

### 0.1 Sample Intake Baseline — Completed

**Expected outcome**: a dropped local evidence bundle produces a stable intake
summary showing recognized artifacts, unsupported artifacts, parse status, and
obvious evidence gaps.

- Treat the tracked template under `templates/evidence-bundle/` as the canonical
  local intake layout.
- Accept the same layout whether it came from a manual local copy workflow or
  from `scripts/collection/Invoke-CmtraceEvidenceCollection.ps1`.
- Accept a local investigation folder as a mixed evidence bundle, not just a log
  directory.
- Classify inputs into logs, registry exports, event-log exports, and unknown
  artifacts.
- Show recognized source families, parse success/failure, and any high-value
  missing evidence.
- Preserve deterministic ordering so intake results are easy to compare across
  runs and samples.
- Shipped status: bundle inspection, intake classification, expected-evidence
  gap reporting, and bundle summary UI now cover this baseline.

### 0.2 Evidence Inventory and Provenance — Completed

**Expected outcome**: each diagnostic summary can answer which artifacts were
included, which were ignored, and which file or snapshot produced each notable
event.

- Use `manifest.json` and `notes.md` as first-class inventory inputs when they
  are present.
- Add an evidence inventory view with source type, origin path, time coverage,
  and parse status.
- Surface provenance throughout summaries and timelines instead of collapsing
  everything into a single implied source.
- Make it obvious when conclusions are based on partial evidence or a narrow
  subset of the supplied bundle.
- Shipped status: inventory, provenance, expected evidence, notes, and manifest
  preview are now exposed in the bundle dialog, and bundle context is surfaced
  in Intune and dsregcmd views.

### 0.3 Parser Hardening from Real Samples — In Progress

**Expected outcome**: existing Windows and IME parsers fail less often on real
samples and produce fewer generic or misclassified events.

- Use real investigation samples to tighten detection, multiline handling,
  timestamp parsing, and severity mapping.
- Prioritize the parsers that already unlock common device investigations before
  adding niche formats.
- Track unsupported line patterns and unknown source families so hardening work
  stays sample-led.
- Current status: artifact-level parse diagnostics are live, and
  CBS/DISM/Panther already salvage unexpected-level structural records more
  cleanly. Remaining work is further sample-led hardening for other parser
  families and IME rules.

### 0.4 Registry Snapshot Support — Mostly Completed

**Expected outcome**: registry evidence is ingested as structured device state
that can be queried, compared, and correlated with log timelines.

- Treat registry data as state snapshots, not as another line-log parser.
- Start with exported `.reg` and other practical snapshot inputs that show
  enrollment, policy, and app-management state.
- Align collector output and manual bundle intake so registry snapshots land
  under the same `evidence/registry/` shape.
- Normalize keys, values, and hives so policy, enrollment, and health views can
  reference them directly.
- Support side-by-side comparison of intended state, effective state, and
  observed failures where that evidence exists.
- Current status: exported `.reg` inspection and preview are shipped; richer
  state comparison and correlation views remain open.

### 0.5 Curated Event Log Intake — Mostly Completed

**Expected outcome**: adjacent event evidence can be added to a local
investigation in a focused way without requiring a full generic event viewer
first.

- Start with curated channels relevant to MDM, Autopilot, enrollment, BitLocker,
  LAPS, and Defender.
- Prefer practical intake paths such as saved exports or offline investigation
  artifacts before expanding to a broad live-channel browser.
- Align collector output and manual bundle intake so curated event exports land
  under the same `evidence/event-logs/` shape.
- Correlate event IDs, levels, and timestamps back into the shared evidence
  inventory and timelines.
- Current status: curated event-log exports are classified and previewed in the
  bundle flow. Full event extraction and correlation remain open.

### 0.6 Remote Collection Feeding Shared Bundle Shape — Not Started

**Expected outcome**: evidence collected remotely still lands in the same
reviewable bundle shape as local manual copies and local script runs.

- Keep remote execution focused on producing `manifest.json`, `notes.md`, and
  the existing `evidence/` folder layout.
- Support Intune or other management delivery only as transport and execution
  layers, not as a different evidence schema.
- Reuse the same intake, inventory, and provenance logic regardless of whether
  the bundle was assembled locally or remotely.

### 0.7 Intune Rule Maintenance from New Samples — In Progress

**Expected outcome**: current Intune diagnostics stays useful without becoming
the primary feature track.

- Keep refining IME rules only when new samples expose repeatable gaps.
- Expand remediation guidance only where evidence remains deterministic and
  reviewable.
- Avoid large new Intune-only UI work unless it directly supports the broader
  evidence-bundle intake flow.
- Current status: diagnostics coverage, provenance, repeated-failure grouping,
  and evidence-based summaries are already stronger; more IME rule maintenance
  remains sample-led rather than roadmap-led.

---

## 1. Parser Expansion

Current state: core CMTrace, simple, plain text, and timestamped parsing are in
place. Additional Windows log families remain useful, but parser work should now
be driven by real evidence intake and evidence gaps rather than format coverage
for its own sake.

### 1.1 CBS/Panther Format Family — P1 / M

**Covers**: `CBS.log`, `dism.log`, `DPX\setupact.log`, `setupact.log`,
`setuperr.log`, `WinSetup`, `MoSetup`

Shared line pattern:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, <Level> <Component> <Message>
```

- Supports `Info`, `Error`, `Warning`, `Perf`
- Some lines include an optional hex token such as `[0x0f0082]`
- `[SR]` identifies SFC entries within CSI lines
- Continuation lines have no timestamp and should append to the prior entry
- HRESULTs often appear at the end of the message

**Implementation notes**:

- A single `parser/cbs.rs` module can cover this family.
- Detect with `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\s\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2},\s`.
- Extract HRESULTs for error lookup.
- Map `[SR]` lines to a synthetic `SFC` component if that improves filtering.

### 1.2 SetupAPI Section-Based Format — P2 / M

**Covers**: `setupapi.dev.log`, `setupapi.setup.log`

Section-delimited format using `>>>` and `<<<` markers rather than one entry per
line.

```text
>>>  [Device Install (Hardware initiated) - USB\VID_045E&PID_07A5\...]
>>>  Section start 2026/03/09 14:05:57.100
     dvi: {Build Driver List} 14:05:57.115
<<<  Section end 2026/03/09 14:05:58.220
<<<  [Exit status: SUCCESS]
```

- ANSI / system codepage input needs Windows-1252 fallback
- Body prefixes include `ump`, `ndv`, `dvi`, `inf`, `cpy`, `sto`, `sig`, `flq`
- Exit state is usually `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE(0x...)`

**Implementation notes**:

- Model each section as a collapsed logical entry.
- Use the section title as the message and the section type as the component.
- Map `FAILURE` to Error and `SUCCESS` to Info.
- Tree-like expansion is optional follow-on UI work, not a prerequisite for
  parser support.

### 1.3 MSI Multi-Format Parser — P2 / M

**Covers**: `MSI*.LOG` files from `%TEMP%`

MSI logs mix several line types in a single file:

- `Action start HH:MM:SS: ActionName.`
- `MSI (s) (PID:TID) [HH:MM:SS:mmm]: <message>`
- `Property(S): PropertyName = Value`
- Unprefixed custom action stdout/stderr

**Implementation notes**:

- Classify by prefix, then dispatch to sub-parsers.
- Map `Return value 3` to Error and `Return value 2` to Warning.
- Extract property pairs for a structured detail view later.
- Detect from `=== Verbose logging started` or early `MSI (` lines.

### 1.4 WindowsUpdate.log — P1 / S

**Covers**: generated `WindowsUpdate.log`

```text
YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS.mmmmmmm PID  TID  <Component>  <Message>
```

- Uses 7-digit fractional seconds
- Common markers include `*START*`, `*END*`, `*FAILED*`, and `FATAL:`

**Implementation notes**:

- Extend the timestamped parser or add a dedicated variant.
- Promote `*FAILED*` and `FATAL:` to Error severity.
- Detect with `^\d{4}/\d{2}/\d{2}\s\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\.\d{7}`.

### 1.5 ReportingEvents.log (Tab-Delimited) — P2 / S

**Covers**: `C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\ReportingEvents.log`

Tab-delimited rows containing GUID, timestamp, event ID, category, level, update
GUID, HRESULT, agent, status, operation, and message.

**Implementation notes**:

- Add `parser/tab_delimited.rs`.
- Split on tabs and map fields positionally.
- Detect when the first data row starts with `{` and includes tab characters.

### 1.6 W3C Extended Log Format — P2 / S

**Covers**: `pfirewall.log`

Self-describing format using a `#Fields:` header.

**Implementation notes**:

- Parse the `#Fields:` header into a dynamic column map.
- Skip comment lines beginning with `#`.
- Map `DROP` to Warning and `ALLOW` to Info.
- Opening firewall logs should still explain that logging is often disabled by
  default.

### 1.7 XML Log Format — P3 / S

**Covers**: `Diagerr.xml`, `Diagwrn.xml`

**Implementation notes**:

- Use `quick-xml`.
- Map each `<Diagnostic>` element to one log entry.
- Default `Diagerr.xml` to Error and `Diagwrn.xml` to Warning unless the XML
  payload says otherwise.

### 1.8 UTF-16 Encoded Logs — P3 / S

**Covers**: `SrtTrail.txt`, `PFRO.log`

**Implementation notes**:

- Add UTF-16 LE BOM detection to the encoding path.
- `PFRO.log` should parse operation lines and error codes.
- `SrtTrail.txt` should surface section and key-value content as structured
  entries.

### 1.9 Auto-Detection Update

Extend `parser/detect.rs` in roughly this priority order:

```text
1. UTF-16 BOM
2. <?xml
3. <![LOG[
4. #Version: or #Fields:
5. >>> at line start
6. === at line start or MSI (
7. {GUID}\t
8. YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,
9. YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS.NNNNNNN
10. existing timestamped/simple/plain fallback chain
```

---

## 2. Intune Diagnostics

Current state: folder-based IME analysis, source provenance, sidecar-aware event
extraction, timeline attribution, deterministic counters, issue clustering, and
first-pass suggested fixes are already in place. This area is good enough for
now; remaining work should be sample-driven maintenance plus correlation with
broader device evidence.

### 2.1 IME Rule Hardening from Real Samples — P1 / M

The core sidecar set is already ingested. The remaining gap is richer extraction
and stronger evidence quality from the highest-value files in
`C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\IntuneManagementExtension\Logs\`, but that work should
stay behind real sample demand instead of driving the roadmap on its own.

| Log File                     | Diagnostic Value                                              | Remaining Gap                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AppWorkload.log`            | Detailed Win32 and WinGet download, staging, and install flow | Better classification of stalled, partial, and retried download/install paths |
| `AppActionProcessor.log`     | Assignment decisions, applicability, and workflow transitions | Better evidence for applicability and policy-evaluation failures              |
| `AgentExecutor.log`          | Script command lines, output, and exit codes                  | More reliable remediation of script-specific failure patterns                 |
| `HealthScripts.log`          | Proactive remediation scheduling and execution                | Better detection vs. remediation separation and recurring failure patterns    |
| `ClientHealth.log`           | Agent startup and service health                              | Low-volume but useful health evidence still missing                           |
| `ClientCertCheck.log`        | Certificate validation                                        | Specific certificate-failure signatures still missing                         |
| `DeviceHealthMonitoring.log` | Readiness and app-crash telemetry                             | Not yet tied into diagnostics summaries                                       |
| `Sensor.log`                 | SensorFramework events                                        | Likely lower-value unless sample sets prove otherwise                         |
| `Win32AppInventory.log`      | Inventory scans                                               | Useful for app state context, not yet correlated deeply                       |
| `ImeUI.log`                  | End-user notification flow                                    | Nice context, low priority for root-cause diagnostics                         |

**Implementation notes**:

- Keep `AppWorkload.log` first because service release 2408 shifted more
  download and install detail there.
- Bias toward explicit rule coverage for retries, stalled content, applicability
  rejection, timeout loops, and recurring remediation failures.
- Prefer evidence that can be quoted back to the user in the summary panel.

### 2.2 Curated Event Log Channel Integration — P1 / M

Event logs remain the largest adjacent diagnostic gap for MDM, Autopilot,
BitLocker, LAPS, and Defender.

**Priority channels**:

| Channel                                                             | Use Case                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics-Provider/Admin`            | Primary MDM failures and CSP operations |
| `DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics-Provider/Operational`      | Ongoing MDM activity                    |
| `Microsoft-Windows-AAD/Operational`                                 | Entra registration and token flow       |
| `Microsoft-Windows-ModernDeployment-Diagnostics-Provider/Autopilot` | Autopilot deployment events             |
| `Microsoft-Windows-BitLocker/BitLocker Management`                  | Encryption and key rotation             |
| `Microsoft-Windows-LAPS/Operational`                                | LAPS events                             |
| `Microsoft-Windows-SENSE/Operational`                               | Defender onboarding and connectivity    |
| `Intune-Bootstrapper-Agent`                                         | Autopilot Device Preparation            |

**Implementation notes**:

- Start with curated exports and focused channel intake before building a broad
  event-log browser.
- Use the `windows` crate for native EVTX access on Windows where native channel
  access is needed.
- Map Event ID, Level, and message text into the existing entry model.
- Start with curated channel presets instead of a full generic event viewer.
- Offline `.evtx` file support can follow later.

### 2.3 Autopilot Diagnostics Panel — P1 / L

Build a dedicated Autopilot view that correlates profile files, ESP state,
relevant event logs, and setup logs.

**Panel goals**:

- Detect deployment mode
- Show ESP phase progress and failure points
- Summarize profile configuration
- Correlate known event IDs and failure signatures
- Support Autopilot v2 bootstrapper and provisioning hints

### 2.4 Registry-Backed MDM Policy Viewer — P1 / L

Read structured device state from registry paths such as:

- `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\current\device\<Area>\`
- `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\Providers\<GUID>\default\Device\<Area>\`
- `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Enrollments\<GUID>\`

**Features**:

- Compare intended vs. effective values
- Highlight MDM and Group Policy conflicts
- Link CSP paths to documentation
- Export policy snapshots as JSON

**Implementation note**:

- Treat registry intake as structured state and correlation data, not as another
  log stream.

### 2.5 macOS Intune Log Support — P3 / XL

macOS Intune logs use a pipe-delimited format:

```text
DateTime | Process | LogLevel | PID | Task | TaskInfo
```

**Implementation notes**:

- Add a `parser/pipe_delimited.rs` parser.
- Map `I`, `W`, and `E` to standard severities.
- Add curated macOS predicates only if Windows-focused work no longer dominates.

### 2.6 Diagnostics Coverage and Guided Insight — P1 / M

The current diagnostics panel is useful, but it still needs better confidence
and coverage reporting.

**Remaining work**:

- Add per-file counts, oldest/newest timestamps, rotation awareness, and
  dominant-source reporting.
- Improve repeated-failure grouping for apps, scripts, downloads, and timeout
  loops.
- Expand rule-based suggested fixes only where known error codes or evidence are
  strong enough.
- Keep the output auditable with sections such as `Likely Cause`, `Evidence`,
  `Next Checks`, and `Suggested Fix`.

---

## 3. CMTrace Feature Parity

These are the main gaps relative to the original CMTrace workflow.

### 3.1 Time Delta Calculation (Ctrl+D) — P0 / S

Show elapsed time between log entries.

- Single selection: first entry to selected entry
- Range selection: first selected to last selected
- Status bar format: `Elapsed time is Xh Xm Xs Xms (X.XXX seconds)`

### 3.2 Save As / Export (Ctrl+S) — P0 / S

Export the current filtered view to:

- Plain text matching CMTrace clipboard shape
- CSV with headers
- Visible entries only

**Implementation notes**:

- Reuse the existing clipboard/export path where possible.
- Respect active filters.
- Add save dialog plus format selection.

### 3.3 Preferences / Settings Dialog — P1 / M

Persist application settings such as highlight behavior, column state, window
placement, theme, font size, recent files, and find history.

**Implementation notes**:

- Use `tauri-plugin-store` or filesystem-backed persistence.
- Load settings on startup and expose them through the existing state layer.

### 3.4 Multi-File Support — P1 / L

Support both:

1. Tabbed file viewing with per-tab state
2. Merged chronological view with a source column

Memory pressure and timestamp quality are the main constraints.

### 3.5 Print Support (Ctrl+P) — P2 / M

Print the current visible log view with filter and range context.

### 3.6 Regex Support in Find/Filter — P1 / S

Add optional regex matching to Find and Filter with inline validation.

### 3.7 Find History — P2 / S

Persist and expose the last 10 search terms.

### 3.8 Recent Files Menu — P2 / S

Add a recent files menu or toolbar entry backed by persisted file history.

### 3.9 Column Customization — P2 / M

Allow resize, reorder, and show/hide column state with persistence.

---

## 4. UI/UX

### 4.1 Severity Quick-Filter Buttons — P0 / S

Add toolbar toggles for Errors, Warnings, and Info with count badges and
keyboard shortcuts.

### 4.2 Dark Theme — P1 / S

Add theme support using CSS custom properties plus System, Light, and Dark
selection.

### 4.3 Entry Count and Position Indicator — P1 / S

Show current position, total entries, filtered count, and severity totals in the
status bar.

### 4.4 Go-To Line / Go-To Timestamp — P2 / S

Add a `Ctrl+G` dialog for absolute line jumps or nearest timestamp jumps.

### 4.5 Bookmark / Pin Entries — P2 / M

Support session bookmarks, quick navigation, and a visible bookmark indicator.

### 4.6 Log Entry Detail Enhancement — P2 / S

Improve the info pane with structured parsed fields, source metadata, inline
error lookup, and clickable URLs.

### 4.7 Tail Mode Indicator — P1 / S

Make live tail state obvious with a `LIVE` badge, jump-to-latest affordance, and
entry-rate context.

---

## 5. Error Lookup

### 5.1 Expand Embedded Error Database — P1 / M

Current coverage is still well below CMTrace's embedded set.

**High-value additions**:

- Windows Update Agent errors
- Intune-specific error families
- Standard HRESULT ranges
- NTSTATUS codes
- MDM enrollment errors
- BitLocker, LAPS, Autopilot, WinHTTP, and COM/DCOM errors

**Implementation notes**:

- Consider generating from public Microsoft references where practical.
- Use `FormatMessage` on Windows as a fallback for unknown codes.
- A data file may be easier to maintain than an ever-growing hardcoded Rust
  table.

### 5.2 Inline Error Detection — P1 / S

Detect common hex and decimal error-code patterns in messages and expose hover
or click lookup.

### 5.3 Error Code Hyperlinking — P2 / S

Link recognized codes to inline lookup and, where appropriate, external
documentation for that error family.

---

## 6. Performance

### 6.1 Incremental Parsing — P1 / M

Avoid full re-parse on each tail cycle by tracking byte offsets and appending
only newly parsed entries.

### 6.2 Background Parsing with Progress — P2 / M

For large files, show parse progress, stream results progressively, and allow
cancellation.

### 6.3 Parser Plugin System — P3 / XL

Custom parser definitions remain a long-term architectural option, not a
near-term priority.

### 6.4 Memory-Mapped File Reading — P3 / M

Use mapped I/O for very large files only if simpler parsing improvements stop
being sufficient.

---

## 7. Integrations

### 7.1 Collect Diagnostics Bundle Support — P1 / L

Open remotely collected diagnostics bundles and expose logs, registry exports,
event-log exports, and command output from one entry point, using the same
evidence-bundle shape as the tracked template and local PowerShell collector.

### 7.2 MDM Diagnostic Report Viewer — P2 / M

Parse `MDMDiagHtmlReport.html` and `MDMDiagReport.xml` to surface policy values,
enrollment variables, certificates, and conflicts.

### 7.3 Graph API GUID Resolution — P2 / L

Optionally resolve extracted Intune app and policy GUIDs to friendly names
through Microsoft Graph.

### 7.4 Command-Line Interface — P2 / S

Support startup arguments for opening files, launching Intune analysis, and
applying an initial filter.

### 7.5 Log File Health Check — P3 / S

When opening an IME directory, summarize rotation state, time coverage, large
gaps, and size vs. configured limits.

---

## 8. Prioritized Implementation Phases

## Completed

Shipped work that should no longer appear as active roadmap items:

- The tracked evidence-bundle template lives under `templates/evidence-bundle/`
  and is intended to be copied to a local working folder outside the repo.
- The PowerShell collector at
  `scripts/collection/Invoke-CmtraceEvidenceCollection.ps1` produces the same
  high-level `manifest.json` + `notes.md` + `evidence/` bundle shape for local
  or remote execution.
- Evidence bundle inspection is available from the app and now exposes artifact
  intake classification, expected evidence, manifest and notes preview, and
  parser-quality summary.
- Bundle inventory is surfaced through the shipped bundle summary dialog instead
  of living only in the collector output.
- Registry snapshot exports can be inspected as structured adjacent evidence
  from the bundle flow.
- Curated event-log exports can be classified and previewed from the same bundle
  flow.
- Log, Intune, and dsregcmd workspaces now retain bundle provenance so
  investigations can tell when results came from a bundle-backed source.
- Artifact-level parse diagnostics are available for recognized log artifacts.
- CBS, DISM, and Panther parsers now salvage structurally valid timestamped
  records with unexpected level tokens instead of dropping them to raw fallback.
- Log sources are first-class inputs: file, folder, and known platform presets.
- Folder open and file browsing are available in the main log workflow,
  including toolbar access.
- Known source presets include Windows IME logs and route through the shared
  source-loading flow.
- Intune analysis accepts an IME folder path, not only a single file.
- IME folder discovery includes the documented sidecar bundle instead of
  narrowing to `IntuneManagementExtension*.log` only.
- Intune results retain and display expanded source-file provenance in the
  frontend model, summary/header, and event timeline.
- File-aware Intune extraction covers `AppWorkload.log`,
  `AppActionProcessor.log`, `AgentExecutor.log`, and `HealthScripts.log`.
- Sidecar events use more specific heuristic naming for install phases, policy
  evaluation, and detection/remediation context.
- Aggregated IME timelines sort by parsed timestamps and collapse duplicate
  completion events more reliably.
- Intune summary output includes deterministic counters for pending, timed out,
  failed downloads, successful downloads, and failed scripts.
- Intune diagnostics include evidence-based issue clustering, next checks, and
  rule-based suggested fixes where evidence is specific enough.
- Parser expansion has been intentionally deprioritized behind sample-driven
  evidence quality and correlated investigation work.
